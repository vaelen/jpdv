src/jpdv/vectorspace/*.java - This code was borrowed from a blog article by Sujit Pal.  The code was
                              later incorporated into his project: My Java Text Mining Toolkit (JTMT) 
                              which is located here: http://jtmt.sourceforge.net/
                              He released this code under the LGPL, but it is apparently being moved
                              into commons-math-2.0, so I will eventually try to add that project as
                              a dependency instead of incorporating the code from the original blog
                              article here directly.
